# FishByte

## Description

FishByte is a text-based fishing game written in Python. It's a passion project born from a love of fishing and classic text-based RPGs. The game is currently in its early stages, but the foundation is in place for a much larger and more feature-rich experience.

## What's New (June 21, 2025)

*   **The Shop is Open!** You can now spend your hard-earned coins on new fishing rods.
*   **New Fish!** A variety of new fish have been added to the game.

## Gameplay

The core gameplay loop is simple:

1.  **Fish:** Use the `fish` command to cast your line and catch a variety of fish.
2.  **Sell Fish:** Sell your catches to earn coins.
3.  **View Inventory:** Check your inventory to see your fish, coins, and other items.
4.  **Enter Shop:** Use your coins to buy better fishing rods and other equipment.
5.  **Save Game:** Save your progress.
6.  **Exit:** Exit the game.
7.  **Play Tutorial:** Learn the basics of the game.

## The Shop

You can now access the shop by typing `shop` or `4` in the main menu. Here, you can purchase new fishing rods that will allow you to catch rarer and more valuable fish.

## The Fish Database

One of the things I'm most proud of in this project is the fish database. The `new_fish.json` file contains all the data for the fish in the game, including their names, rarities, values, and catch rates. I have a passion for creating a unique and diverse set of fish, and I've handcrafted the entire database without the use of AI. I've recently added a bunch of new fish to the game, so there's more to discover than ever before!

## AI Assistance

While the fish database is 100% human-made, I have used AI for code assistance in other areas of the project. For example, the `fish` function in `helpers.py`, which determines which fish is caught based on a weighted random choice, was developed with the help of an AI assistant. I've also used AI for general assistance with debugging and code optimization. However, the rest of the core logic of the game was coded by hand.

## Future Plans

My ultimate goal for FishByte is to develop it into a full-fledged game with a graphical user interface (GUI). This text-based version is the first step in that journey, and I'm excited to continue building on it.

## How to Play

To play FishByte, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer. Then, simply run the following command in your terminal once you've cloned the repository:

```
python main.py
```
